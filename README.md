POI Highlighting Tool
---

Pedestrians can greatly benefit from seeing what POIs are around them when they are routing from point A to B. This design prototype allows users to set a start and end point on a map, then see the optimal walking route and POIs along that route wihtin a certain radius. The 'Route Design Settings' UI allows users to edit parameters of routing during the motion.
POIs are sourced from [MapBox Streets V8](https://docs.mapbox.com/data/tilesets/reference/mapbox-streets-v8/).
